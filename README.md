- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Oqba-Jawed
As a Computer Scientist, I possess proficiency in Python. I am a motivated learner of Artificial Intelligence with
a keen interest in nature-inspired Genetic Algorithms, including Evolutionary Algorithm, and Ant Colony Optimization.
Additionally, I have expertise in Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuning, where I specialize in refining models for specific
tasks. My commitment to self-improvement and continuous learning is evident in my current exploration of solving real-
world problems using regression and classification through Deep Learning Neural Networks. I am enthusiastic about
applying these skills to address challenging NP-hard problems.<!---
